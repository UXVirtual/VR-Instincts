# The Goal
For now all I'm doing is uploading code from my website, But in the future I want this to be a community project that makes amazing VR games super easy to code.

#How to Help
The way this is set up is as a unity project that .unitypackages builds can be made from. 
People can contribue by touching up code (check the Issues tab), making the mechaincs better (look in projects tab to see if I've suggested anything), and adding your own game mechanics. If you add your own mechanics please doccument them and add a lot of comments in the code about exactly how it works. One final thing you could do is make this page better.
